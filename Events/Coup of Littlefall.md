[Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), king of [Forth](/Geography/Forth (kingdom).md) died abruptly, but of natural causes, on the 45th day of spring.
According to the law of the kingdom, his spouse, [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) was to inherit power.
After announcing his death to the people of [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) decided for 8 days of mourning, and retired to her quarters.
[Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md), high priest of the [Church of the Fallen One](/Organisations/Church Of The Fallen One.md), who advised the queen for this extended mourning, tipped the [Mafia-Cartel](Organi) beforehand.
In the night of the seventh day of mourning, the [Mafia-Cartel](Org), along with some hundreds paid mercenaries, simultaneously attacked the royal castle and other strategic places in the city, having bribed part of the personnel of the city guard.
This forced the royal family to flee.
They then announced that the kingdom was theirs.

The royal family first decided to flee to the portuary city of [Tabadum](/Geography/City of Tabadum.md), to the west of [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), where the family had some well protected and defendable locations.
Upon reaching it, they noticed that the attack of the [Mafia-Cartel]() was actually much more profound than first understood, and that even in [Tabadum](/Geography/City of Tabadum.md), their allies were present.

This led to them trying to flee further away.
By chance, a small flotilla led by prince [Testur](/Characters/Testur.md) and here for commercial reasons accepted to take them in and to sail to the west, until they reached [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md).
