[Jahob](King), king of [Forth]() died abruptly, but of natural causes, on the 45th day of spring.
According to the law of the kingdom, his spouse, [Alianne]() was to inherit power.
After announcing his death to the people of [Littlefall](), [Alianne]() desided for 8 days of mourning, and retired to her quarters.
[Salaman](priest), high priest of the [Church of the Fallen One](religion), who advised the queen for this extended mourning, tipped the [Mafia-Cartel](Organi) beforehand.
In the night of second day of mourning, the [Mafia-Cartel](Org), along with many hundreds payed mercenaries, simultaneously attacked many important points of the city, having bribed some personnel of the city guard, and making the royal family flee.
They then announced that the kingdom was theirs.

The royal family first decided to flee to the portuary city of [Tabadum](City), to the west of [Littlefall](), where the family had some well protected and defendable locations.
Upon reaching it, they noticed that the attack of the [Mafia-Cartel]() was actually much more profound than first understood, and that even in [Tabadum](), their allies were present.

This led to them trying to flee further away.
By chance, a small flotilla led by prince [Testur]() and here for commercial reasons accepted to take them in and to sail to the west, until they reached [Continent II]().
