The elves are an almost feral humano√Ød species living mainly in naturally isolated places.

# Anatomy
From a distance, an elf could be mistaken for a human; they often share the sveltness of children or women.
The tint of their skin is dependent on their specific milieu, varying from a light brown-green to almost white.
Some males have been seen to have antlers, up to the size of an arm.

# Geographic Distribution
The elvish population is rather evenly distributed across all continents and lands.
They prefer hardly accessible places and seem to thrive when left alone.

# Society
The typical societal structure for elves is tribes of between 10 and 20 individuals.
Those tribes are hunters gatherers, although some have shown early signs of cultivation and animal domestication.
There is a non negligible quantity of elves living alone, or in larger groups than the dozen.

# Magic
Elves have a relatively strong [magical](/Magic/Magic.md) footprint; they are influenced by and influence it, but not conciously.

# Number, Magic and Behavior
Elves are influenced by the number and proximity of their pairs.
The closer they are to each other, the stronger their magical footprint, their conection to each other, and therefore the stronger they are.
At the same time, this proximity brings their animal behaviour forward and the little culture and society they had starts to fade in the light of something more savage.
