The elves are a humano√Ød species living mainly in naturally isolated places.

# Anatomy
From a distance, an elf could be mistaken for a human; they often share the sveltness of children or women.
The tint of their skin is dependent on their specific milieu, varying from a light brown-green to almost white.
Some males have been seen to have antlers, up to the size of an arm.

# Geographic Distribution
Elves have been seen to live on practically every places, from cold to very warm.
Their repartition is sparse but relatively well distributed.

# Society
The typical societal structure for elves is tribes of between 10 and 20 individuals.
Those tribes are hunters gatherers, although some have been seen to show bare forms of cultivation and animal domestication.
Elves have also been seen living alone, or in larger numbers, in which case their societal structure begins to collapse.

# Magic
Elves have a relatively strong [magical](/Magic/Magic.md) footprint; they are influenced and influence by it, but not conciously.

# Number, Magic and Behavior
Elves are influenced by the number and proximity of their pairs.
The closer they are to each other, the stronger their magical footprint, their conection to each other, and therefore the stronger they are.
At the same time, this proximity brings their animal behaviour forward and the little culture and society they had starts to fade in the light of something more savage.
