Islands to the south and between [Continent I]() and [Continent II]().

The climate is rather cold, but still temperate.

During the ruling of [King Jahob](), the population of the Southern Islands traded with him.
At his death and the coup, they stopped the trading with [Continent I]() (The [Mafia-Cartel]()) but instead continued trading with the heirs of the king and his wife, hence with the newly founded [Kestalis]().

The fidelity of the traders of the islands is one of the main reasons [Kestalis]() came to be, and grew as rapidly as it did.
