Islands to the south and between [Continent I]() and [Continent II]().

The climate is rather cold, but still temperate.

The fidelity of the traders of the islands is one of the main reasons [Kestalis]() came to be, and grew as rapidly as it did.

## Politics

The Southern Islands are divided into small semi independent kingdoms and states, whose borders often change due to association of neighbooring states or division, and change of rulers.
Even though the political borders are quite fluid, a relative peace still dominates the islands.


## Society

Due to their relative isolation from the other continents but closeness one from each other, the southern islands have a relatively uniform culture; the political borders aren't cultural ones.
