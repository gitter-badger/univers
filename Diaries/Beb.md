> Today, I went to the shop early to get some work done before sunrise and try and be free early in the afternoon to go to the baths.
> My cough got worse this past week and I think the moist air of the baths would do me some good. 
> So, I went to the shop before sunrise and started working.
> Then, the boss came around, he was happy of the work I'd done so far and told me to go attend the front for a while, take care of the clients. 
> There weren't many.  
> First, a woman came and bought two ribs. 
> Then a poor old man for some innards, I made him a price because he reminded me of my own old man, he was very thankful.
> Then some more people.
> It was all quite a boring, and then one of the thugs came for the security tax, and I didn't have enough, so he waited there for half an hour until the boss came back from one of his errands.
> The boss wasn't happy, the tax had augmented again, and he told the man so, but the man told the boss that if he wasn't happy, he could always go and talk to his bosses, and even though the boss is not easily scared, I saw he didn't want troubles again, and just paid and asked the thug to leave now.
> After that, he complained to me a bit, and then it was already the middle of the afternoon, and he gave me leave, he said there wouldn't be many clients left and I had worked well and I can go.
> So, I first went by Thamas and we drank and discussed for a while.
> He talked again about his project to go find work in Syrac. 
> He really thinks it would get him more money, but I don't think it will, it's all the same everywhere, so I told him so.
> Then I left him to what he was doing before I came and went to the baths, taking a stroll through the gardens first.
> It's longer but it's much more enjoyable than through the dirty streets.
> The baths were nice and empty, and I stayed a long while, thinking about things and enjoying the hotness.
> Then, I don't know why, I thought about the dwarves again.
> I hope they all burn in their galleries.

Littlefall, the 30rd day of Fall.
