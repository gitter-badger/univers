Kasamir ([-470](/Year/-470.md) until [-399](/Year/-399.md)) was one of the lords of the [Southern Islands]().

He is one of the main figures in the economical development of the [islands](), due to his involvement in trade with [King Jahob]() at first, but more importantly with  [Kestalis]().

Kasamir was a rather close friend to [King Jahob]() and their bond was the basis of a solid trading relation between their two states.
At the death of [Jahob](King), Kasamir, of loyal temperament, stopped the trading with [Littlefall]() but continued it with the family of the deceased king; which growed very rapidly due to the needs of an expanding [Kestalis]().
